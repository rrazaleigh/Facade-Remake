// GODOT 4.5+ ONLY (NOT editor-only). Godot.Logger / OS.AddLogger do NOT exist in the addon's SDK floor
// (Godot.NET.Sdk/4.3.0), so referencing them outside this guard would break the required
// `dotnet build (.NET 8)` CI gate (which pins 4.3.0) with CS0246. The Godot.NET.Sdk defines
// GODOT4_5_OR_GREATER only when building against the 4.5+ SDK (e.g. the infra testbed pins 4.5.1), so this
// whole file compiles in on 4.5+ and out on 4.3/4.4. On the floor, GodotScriptErrorLoggerBridge.TryInstall
// is a no-op stub (see GodotScriptErrorLogger.Stub.cs) and script-validate falls back to the per-file
// Reload() error-code probe (Tool_Script.Validate.cs).
//
// This file lives under Runtime/ and is NOT gated by #if TOOLS: OS.AddLogger / Godot.Logger are ENGINE
// (runtime) APIs, not editor APIs — available inside a running / exported game as well as the editor. Two
// consumers install the SAME bridge:
//   * the editor boot (Editor/GodotMcpPlugin.cs) captures engine script errors raised IN-EDITOR, and
//   * the in-game runtime (Runtime/RuntimeErrorCapture.cs) captures engine errors raised in the RUNNING
//     GAME (GDScript runtime errors, push_error/push_warning, shader errors) — closing the gap where in-game
//     runtime errors were invisible to the agent (issue #160).
// The runtime/editor boundary guard (scripts/check-runtime-boundary.py) passes this file because it
// references no editor-only API (EditorInterface / EditorPlugin / EditorFileSystem / EditorScript) — only
// the engine OS singleton + Godot.Logger.
